1.1  What is it?
    

Applications
The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit's cross-platform Virtual
Machine design and implementation supports a broad assortment of
user selectable open and proprietary hardware and software
components and platforms:
1    On state-of-the-art platforms incorporating the newest ideas
  and the most up-to-date features
  With high performance 64-bit processors, nCurses-6.x and
  Python 3.6.0 or later GUI applications, it provides that cross-
  platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on character-mode 8-
  /16-/256-color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
  terminals and terminal emulators.
2    On legacy platforms incorporating the oldest ideas and
  traditional features
  With medium or low performance 32-bit processors (or 64-bit
  processors operating in 32-bit compatibility mode), nCurses-
  6.x/5.x and Python 3.6.0 (or Python 2.7.13) or earlier GUI
  applications, it provides that cross-platform, pixel-mode
  "wxPython" feeling on character-mode 8-/16-color (xterm-
  family) and non-color (vt100-family) terminals and terminal
  emulators.
3    Character-mode Terminals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-
  based_user_interface)
  Excerpt From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
  "From [character-mode] text application's point of view, a
  text screen (and communications with it) can belong to one of
  three types (here ordered in order of decreasing
  accessibility):
  a)   A genuine text mode display, controlled by a video adapter
    or the central processor itself. This is a normal condition for a
    locally running application on various types of personal
    computers and mobile devices. If not deterred by the operating
    system, a smart program may exploit the full power of a hardware
    text mode.
b)   A text mode emulator. Examples are xterm for X Window System
and win32 console (in a window mode) for Microsoft Windows. This
usually supports programs which expect a real text mode display,
but may run considerably slower. Certain functions of an advanced
text mode, such as an own font uploading, almost certainly become
unavailable.
c)   A remote text terminal. The communication capabilities
usually become reduced to a serial line or its emulation,
possibly with few ioctl()s as an out-of-band channel in such
cases as Telnet and Secure Shell. This is the worst case, because
software restrictions hinder the use of capabilities of a remote
display device.
  Under Linux and other Unix-like systems, a program easily
  accommodates to any of the three cases because the same
  interface (namely, standard streams) controls the display and
  keyboard. Also, specialized programming libraries help to
  output the text in a way appropriate to the given display
  device and interface to it. ...."

Design
The cross-platform Toolkit includes general purpose, reusable
building block libraries, tools, tests, sample applications and
documentation for users and software development projects. It has
been designed, developed and tested on Intel 32-bit and 64-bit
processors running various releases of the following operating
systems, each of which support multiple users, processes and
tasks/threads:
1    Unix/Solaris Operating Systems
  Unix is a family of computer operating systems that derive
  from the original AT&T UNIX, developed in the 1970s at the
  Bell Labs research center.  It was originally meant to be a
  programmer's workbench to be used for developing software to
  be run on multiple platforms, more than to be used to run
  application software. The system grew larger as the operating
  system started spreading in the academic circle, as users
  added their own tools to the system and shared them with
  colleagues.
  Unix was designed to be portable, multi-tasking and multi-user
  in a time-sharing configuration. Unix systems are
  characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for
  storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and
  certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files;
  and the use of a large number of software tools, small
  programs that can be strung together through a command-line
  interpreter using pipes, as opposed to using a single
  monolithic program that includes all of the same
  functionality.
  Solaris is a Unix operating system originally developed by Sun
  Microsystems. It superseded their earlier SunOS in 1993.
  Oracle Solaris, so named as of 2010, has been owned by Oracle
  Corporation since the Sun acquisition by Oracle in January
  2010. It is known for its scalability, especially on SPARC
  systems, and for originating many innovative features such as
  DTrace, ZFS and Time Slider. Solaris supports SPARC-based and
  x86-based workstations and servers from Oracle and other
  vendors, with efforts underway to port to additional
  platforms. Solaris is registered as compliant with the Single
  Unix Specification.
2    macOS/Mac OS X Operating Systems
  The Unix-based graphical interface operating system composed
  of code developed by Apple Inc., as well as code derived from
  NeXTSTEP, BSD, and other free software projects. It is
  designed to run on Macintosh computers. Within the market of
  desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, OS X is
  the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft
  Windows.
3    GNU/Linux Operating Systems
  The free, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU C library
  (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (coreutils), GNU Debugger (GDB),
  GNU Binary Utilities (binutils), GNU Bash shell, GNOME desktop
  environment and GNU operating system kernel (production Linux
  or pre-production HURD).
4    Microsoft Windows Operating Systems
  Microsoft Windows consists of several families of operating
  systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the
  computing industry. Active Windows families include Windows
  NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass
  subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or
  Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x
  and Windows Mobile.
  Microsoft introduced Windows, in 1985, as a graphical
  operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing
  interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Microsoft
  Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market
  with over 90% usage share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been
  introduced in 1984.
5    Cygwin Unix-like Operating Environment for Microsoft Windows
  Cygwin was originally developed by Cygnus Solutions, which was
  later acquired by Red Hat. It is free and open source
  software, released under the GNU Lesser General Public License
  version 3. Today it is maintained by employees of Red Hat,
  NetApp and many other volunteers.
  It is a GNU/Linux-like environment and command-line interface
  for Microsoft Windows. It provides native integration of
  Windows-based applications, data, and other system resources
  with applications, software tools, and data of the Unix-like
  environment. Thus it is possible to launch Windows
  applications from the Cygwin environment, as well as to use
  Cygwin tools and applications within the Windows operating
  context.
  It consists of two parts: a dynamic-link library (DLL) as an
  API compatibility layer providing a substantial part of the
  POSIX API functionality, and an extensive collection of
  software tools and applications that provide a Unix-like look
  and feel.
6    Python
  The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkits common User Interface
  and Application Programming Interface supports two
  implementations:
  a)   The Python 2x generation offers only legacy features,
    capabilities and limitations on historically available hardware
    and software platforms. The final 2.x version 2.7 release came
    out in mid-2010, with a statement of extended support for this
    end-of-life release. The 2.x branch will see no new major
    releases after that.
    Command Line Interface features are released for Python
    2.0.1-2.7.13.
    Graphical-style User Interface features are released for
    Python 2.6.4-2.7.13.
  b)   The Python 3x generation offers enhanced features,
    capabilities and limitations. Python 3.x is under active
    development and has already seen over five years of stable
    releases, including version 3.3 in 2012, 3.4 in 2014, 3.5 in 2015
    and 3.6 in 2016. This means that all recent standard library
    improvements, for example, are only available by default in
    Python 3.x.
    Command Line Interface features are released for Python
    3.0.1-3.5.3 and 3.6.0.
    Graphical-style User Interface features are released for
    Python 3.1.5-3.5.3 and 3.6.0 (the first Python release to
    support 64-bit nCurses-6.x).
  c)   Despite their internal differences, Python's growing
    popularity demonstrates its usefulness and effectiveness. It is
    an easily learned high level object oriented programming
    language. It has a clean easy to read syntax, high-level data
    structures, dynamic typing, and rich support libraries which
    combine to make Python a very productive tool for many types of
    programming.
d)   The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit can be installed and
will operate, without change, on any 32-bit or 64-bit computer
processor and operating system that supports official Python
releases from the Python Software Foundation.


1.2  How can you get it?
    
You must use a WEB browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge, Konqueror, Opera and
Safari) and a mouse button click to "view" and "download" or
"clone" the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit to your computer's
desktop or to another convenient location.
Though you do not need to become a "GitHub" member, you must use
the following internet WEB address to view or obtain a copy of
the Toolkit repository:
  TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit
  (https://github.com/rigordo959/tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository)
1    To view the contents of any Toolkit directory or file on the
  GitHub server:
  You must click on each containing directory before clicking on
  the file. However, if you click on one of the application
  program-specific formatted files (such as Adobe PDF, JPEG
  Image or Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access)
  you may instead get the following error message:
    "View Raw
    (Sorry about that, but we can’t show files that are this big
    right now.)"
2    To download one or more Toolkit directories and files from
  the GitHub source code hosting server:
  a)   "Clone or download"
    Clicking on this button displays a pop-up window having two
    buttons: "Open in Desktop" and "Download ZIP".
  b)   "Open in Desktop"
    Clicking on this button will download a GitHub Desktop setup
    utility. The setup utility will automatically download, to
    your local computer, a compressed "zip" file that includes
    the Toolkit project and its entire version history. It will
    then extract the contents into the newly created Git Desktop
    repository. You must launch GitHub on your computer to
    examine or modify source code files, plain text Documents or
    application program-specific files in the Engineering
    Notebook.
  c)   "Download ZIP"
    Clicking on this button will download, to your local
    computer, a compressed "zip" file which includes only the
    latest version of all Toolkit Repository files. The zip file
    should be found in the "Downloads" directory of your
    computer account. You will need to manually extract the
    contents into a Git repository on your computer's desktop or
    to another convenient location.
3    After the clone or download, to view the contents of any
  Toolkit directory or file on your local computer:
    You must click on each containing directory before clicking
    on the file. However, if you click on one of the application
    program-specific formatted files (such as Adobe PDF, JPEG
    Image or Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint and
    Access) you may instead get the following error message or
    something like it:
    "Unable to locate an application (such as PowerPoint)
    normally associated with the file type/extension (such as
    .ppt). Please select or install a suitable application and
    configure the settings association appropriately."
