Common File Extensions

Every file that is on your computer ends in a period followed by a
three-letter extension. This extension tells Windows what type of file
it is. For example you have two files home.jpg and home.txt. Windows
knows that the file extension .jpg means it is a compressed image and
Windows will open it with an associated program. Similarly, it knows
the .txt file is a text file and will open it with notepad. Windows
does not always automatically know what program should open a specific
extension. For example, if you do not have Word Perfect installed, your
computer may not know what program to use to open the file type that
Word Perfect uses (.wpd). If this is the case it will prompt you to
select a program to try and open it with. In this situation if you
selected Microsoft Word from the list it would most likely be able
to convert and open the .wpd file in Word.

Windows XP turns off the file extensions of known file types by default.
For security reasons it's advised you turn file extensions back on.
Many viruses are sent with a false 2nd extension, such as funnyjoke.txt.vbs.
Windows will hide the extension .vbs (a very common virus extension) and
you will only see funnyjoke.txt. When the file is opened the virus is run.
To turn file extensions back on, open My Computer, and then go to the
Tools, then folder options, and then view. From the list uncheck "Hide
file extensions of known types" and press ok all the way out.
