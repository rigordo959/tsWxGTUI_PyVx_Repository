LICENSE 	LICENSE.txt - The verb license means to give permission. The noun license refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission. A license may be granted by a party ("licensor") to another party ("licensee") as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is "an authorization (by the licensor) to use the licensed material (by the licensee). In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee and/or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations. A licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a (patented) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor. Term: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement. Territory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to "North America" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan. A shorthand definition of license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee." That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so. It is undeniable that intellectual property licensing plays a major role in today's business and economy. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Licensing has been recognized as an independent branch of law. It is born out of the interplay of the doctrine of contract and the principles of intellectual property. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete

Goal-11 	Goal-11 - A means for the operator to use a mouse, trackball or touchpad to select and manipulate GUI objects when the platform supports such a device. Support shall include: a) Left, Right and Wheel/Middle mouse button features such as single-click, double-click and triple-click. b) Scrollbar features such as Left, Right, Up and Down arrow. c) Scrollbar and Slider gauge display whose horizontal or vertical bar shows the relative position (via a single non-blank fill character) and size (via additional non-blank fill characters) of the view area within the associated scrolled text. Gauges are also clickable windows that trigger an associated event (such as scroll the associated displayed text left, right, up or down). A single Left-Click on a ScrollBarGauge moves the text toward or away from the top (first) or bottom (last) horizontal or vertical character in proportion to how close the mouse caret (pointer) was to the arrow buttons at either end of the associated gauge. The relative position and size of the highlighted area in the ScrollBarGauge alerts the operator to the availability of text currently hidden from view. It eliminates any justification for wasting screen real estate by alerting the operator to hidden text via the tilde ("~") character. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete 
Goal-12 	Goal-12 - A means for the operator to use a keyboard to select GUI objects when the platform does not support a mouse, trackball or touchpad. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete

Non-Goal-01 	Non-Goal-01 - A means to emulate each and every capability of the Application Programming Interface (API) of the pixel-mode Graphical User Interface (such as the C++ language based "wxWidgets" and its Python language based "wxPython" wrapper) because the "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit is designed for embedded systems which typically have limited, application-specific processing, memory, communication, input/output and file storage resources. Some may only have character-mode hardware suitable for their operating system's command line console. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete 
Non-Goal-02 	Non-Goal-02 - A means to develop support for pixel-mode GUI features such as icons, proportional fonts and other bit-mapped images because many embedded system displays operate only in character-mode. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete 
Non-Goal-03 	Non-Goal-03 - A means to programmatically re-size the top level application Frame or any other GUI object because: a) The host operating system's command line shell window is opened upon operator login, or subsequent launch command, and the size of the shell window establishes the initial size of the character-mode display (such as "stdscr", the Python "Curses" or GNU "nCurses" low-level GUI-style standard screen). Once a launched CLI or GUI-style appliction hs been terminated, the System Operator may change the size of the shell window. The position of the shell window may be changed at any time. b) The application that directly use the character-mode display (identified as "stdscr" in Python "Curses" or GNU "nCurses") are efficient enough to respond to operator re-sizing events related to the top-level "stdscr" or any associated GUI -style objects. They can also use the "pad" feature to create virtual windows whose out-of-bounds contents are clipped (not displayed) without triggering an error. Those application are responsible for programmatically re-sizing low-level GUI objects and any dependent ones. c) It is not yet known how to make applications programmatically re-size any or all of the high- and low-level GUI-style objects and any dependent ones, without a complete, time consuming application restart. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete 
Non-Goal-04 	Non-Goal-04 - A means and expertise to re-compile and re-build the "nCurses" library and associated Python wrapper with the wide character option needed to support Unicode characters and 256-colors because its installation could adversely effect the operation of host operating system utilities. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete 
Non-Goal-05 	Non-Goal-05 - A means and expertise to extend the Python Curses module to include support for all of the currently available "nCurses" methods and functions. The use of Python C-language extensions is beyond the work scope because the cross-platform "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit is intended to be used on host computer platforms for which the Toolkit developer does not have the access required for qualification testing. From "Extending Python with C or C++": "It is quite easy to add new built-in modules to Python, if you know how to program in C. Such extension modules can do two things that can’t be done directly in Python: they can implement new built-in object types, and they can call C library functions and system calls. To support extensions, the Python API (Application Programmers Interface) defines a set of functions, macros and variables that provide access to most aspects of the Python run-time system. The Python API is incorporated in a C source file by including the header "Python.h". The compilation of an extension module depends on its intended use as well as on your system setup; details are given in later chapters. Do note that if your use case is calling C library functions or system calls, you should consider using the ctypes module rather than writing custom C code. Not only does ctypes let you write Python code to interface with C code, but it is more portable between implementations of Python than writing and compiling an extension module which typically ties you to CPython." 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete 
Non-Goal-06 	Non-Goal-06 - A means and expertise to resolve anomalies in the look and feel of vt100, vt220, xterm, xterm-color, xterm-16color, xterm-88color and xterm-256color terminal emulations that are platform-specific. 	rigordo@comcast.net 		Yes 	Delete
