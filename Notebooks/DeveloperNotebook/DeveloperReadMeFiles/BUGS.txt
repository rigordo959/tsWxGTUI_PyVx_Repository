============= GITHUB - ISSUE TRACKING (ACTIVE) =============

1. GitHub - Issue Tracking (Active; public records)

   The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit has been developed
   for release as free and open source software.

   Its public repository, bugs and other issues are access-
   ible at:

      "https://github.com/rigordo959/
               tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository" 

   The GitHub issues were created by transcribing ones
   previously created on a private Bugzilla server as
   detailed in the following section:

      "2. Bugzilla - Issue Tracking".

Why use GiHub?

   Excerpt from: "https://github.com/features"

   "Field-tested tools for any project.

   GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with
   over 25.8 million repositories. Large or small,
   every repository comes with the same powerful
   tools. These tools are open to the community for
   public projects and secure for private projects.

   Integrated issue tracking.

   A flexible issue tracker lets you stay on top of bugs
   and focus on features.

   Your project's issues page can be as simple or as
   sophisticated as you like. Filter by open and closed
   issues, assignees, labels, and milestones. Sort by
   issue age, number of comments, and update time.

   Keyboard shortcuts make issue assignment and labeling
   fast.

   Only teammates and collaborators can create and view
   issues on private repositories.

   Anyone may create and view issues on public repositories."

========== BUGZILLA - ISSUE TRACKING (DEPRECATED) ==========

2. Bugzilla - Issue Tracking (Deprecated;
                              non-public records;
                              replaced by GitHub)

Though the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit is a multi-level
nested structure of subsystems, building blocks, tools, tests
and documents, Bugzilla imposes a two-level structure of
products and components which was utilized in the following
issues. Since the Bugzilla Appliance is on a private network,
it was necessary to share the issues by reprinting the bug
list.

The following excerpt describes the Bugzilla Appliance. The
Live CD was installed as one of several Guest Operating Sys-
tems on an available desktop computer.

Excerpt from:

   "http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/
           Operating-Systems/
           Linux-Distributions/
           TurnKey-Bugzilla-Live-CD-51860.shtml"

"TurnKey Bugzilla Live CD is an open source and free oper-
ating system based on the highly acclaimed Debian GNU/Linux
distribution and built around the famous and powerful Bug-
zilla web application. It is specifically engineered to act
as a software appliance for those of you who want to deploy
dedicated Bugzilla servers.

Bugzilla is an open source, lightweight, fast, web-based and
general-purpose bug tracker and testing application developed
by the Mozilla project. The appliance includes upstream Bug-
zilla configurations deployed on /var/www/bugzilla and pre-
configured to execute whine and collect statistics at certain
periods of time.

Additionally, the Bugzilla installation supports documentation
and dependency graphs, and it is designed to subdue bothersome
new version notifications. It supports secure connections using
the latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) implementation.

A Postfix mail server for sending email messages to users is
also pre-installed, along with Webmin modules for configuring
Apache, Postfix and MySQL. Please note that the Postfix mail
transfer agent is bound to localhost.

The default username for Web Shell, SSH, MySQL and Webmin is
root, and the default Bugzilla username is admin, which can
be customized via:

   http://appliance_ip/
          editusers.cgi?action=edit&userid=1.

The initial configuration is available at

   http://appliance_ip/editparams.cgi.

It is available for download as Live CD ISO images, supporting
both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. TurnKey Bugzilla is also
available for download as virtual machine images for the OVF,
OpenNode, OpenVZ, Xen and OpenStack virtualization technologies.

The installation process takes a few minutes and requires users
to only choose a partitioning method and where to install the
boot loader. After installation, the first boot configuration
wizard kicks in, allowing users to enter new passwords for the
aforementioned accounts.

At the end of the first boot initialization process, the user
can access the TurnKey Linux Configuration Console from where
the server can be restarted or shutdown. Also, don't forget
to note the IP addresses and ports of the active services.

TurnKey Bugzilla Live CD was reviewed by Marius Nestor 5.0/5"

Enhancement to eliminate overhead during handling of scroll arrow events.
Current design practice features multiple layers of GUI objects which each
create event bindings that must be searched for a connection between triggering
object and ultimate recipient. Current workaround requires elaborate callback
mechanism. Propose revision eliminates intermediate layer bindings and associate
searches.

Comment 1 admin 2015-06-14 04:57:07 EDT
The enhancement would provide a flexible means of handling or recovering from an
iconization which had hidden (rather than re-sized) the frame or dialog and
associated child GUI objects. The alternative to the enhancement is to assume
that hiding had been used and that clicking on a specific taskbar button should
cancel it if hiding was active or else resize it to its previous size.

The curses.textpad module provides a Textbox class that handles elementary text
editing in a curses window, supporting a set of keybindings resembling those of
Emacs (thus, also of Netscape Navigator, BBedit 6.x, FrameMaker, and many other
programs). The module also provides a rectangle-drawing function useful for
framing text boxes or for other purposes.

Unfortunately, its use within the wxPython emulation suspends updates to other
wxPython GUI objects.

   Application programs cannot delete wxPython-style GUI objects.

   Application programs cannot delete wxPython-style GUI objects
   because Python's "nCurses" module does not have the
   "nCurses_delwin" method for deleting "nCurses" style GUI objects.

   Not sure this issue can be resolved. A search for an explanation
   for why Python does not support the delwin function, came upon
   the following "nCurses" man page entry:

   "Calling delwin deletes the named window, freeing all memory
   associated with it (it does not actually erase the window's
   screen image). Subwindows must be deleted before the main
   window can be deleted."

2011/11/10

   Abort Signal (Ctrl-C) Handling

   Applications occasionally terminate without restoring the
   display to its previous state in which keyboard input is
   echoed to the display.

   Troubleshooting Hint:

   The operator must type "stty sane" to manuallly restore the
   display to its normal state.

   The operator might want to Clear Screen by typing Ctrl-L shell
   command"^L".

2012/07/03

   Conflict between need for wxPython's "Show" method and
   emulator's need for Curses' Panel Library

   Limited screen real estate typically necessitates the
   overlapping of window objects. When the operator needs to
   see the features of a partially or totally hidden object,
   a Graphical User Interface uses a Task Bar with buttons
   for each frame or dialog. After moving the mouse over the
   button for the hidden object, the operator can click on
   the mouse button to bring a hidden background object to
   the visible foreground. The Curses-based design provides
   a similar Task Bar.

   However, the current design's use of wxWidgets-/wxPython-
   style "Show" method is incompatible with use of the
   Curses Panel (Stack) library as evidenced by sample code
   (See http://tldp.org/HOWTO/CURSES-Programming-HOWTO/
   panels.html). The sample code doesn't use components
   associated with "Show" method, but the wxPython emulation
   depends on them to accomodate a delay in the creation of
   Curses windows until after the completion of associated
   distributed layouts.

2012/08/11

   Lack of application program blocking mechanism for key-
   board input.

   Keyboard input subject to restrictions:

   tsWxPasswordEntryDialog is derived from tsWxTextEntry-
   Dialog. The latter uses tsWxTextEditBox which has
   usability issues in both non-event driven and event
   driven modes.

   The non-event-driven mode uses curses.textpad.Textbox
   which monopolizes GUI platform and ignores mouse button
   clicks until the operator terminates input via double
   entry of control-G key. It also, responds to operator
   input after the control-G.

   The event driven mode uses an python emulation of
   curses.textpad.Textbox that provides enhanced edit
   capabilities while recognizing mouse button clicks
   and keyboard press-release activity. However, the
   display blinks as each new text character is displayed.
   More imporrtantly, there is no mechanism to block the
   application program pending the operator's completion
   of text input.

   Mouse "Click" Event handling can be unreliable on some
   platforms.

   Mouse "Click" Event handling can be unreliable on some
   platforms. What works on Windows with Cygwin sometimes
   crashes on Ubuntu Linux.

   Troubleshooting Hint:

   Detected caret position, at time of mouse click, con-
   sidered to be outside of displayed GUI object border.

   Perhaps displayed GUI object border must be pre-aligned
   with character cell display.

2012/11/16

   Lack of Pending Event handling.

   wxPython-style event handling should include front-end
   (real time) dispatching or queuing with back-end (idle
   time) ProcessPendingEvent handling.

   While the wxPython emulation is under construction, the
   workaround involves front-end use of tsWxProcess-
   SelectedEventTable. The workaround has been used after
   much trial and error to demonstrate buttons, checkboxes,
   radio buttons and the scroll bar "arrow" buttons and
   gauges associated with text scrolling.

2013/07/16

   Need Frame and Dialog control button event handlers.

   Frame control buttons (ICONIZE, MAXIMIZE/RESTOREDOWN,
   and CLOSE) do not make appropriate changes to display.
   The handlers only output an appropriate text message.

   Dialog control buttons (HELP and CLOSE) do not make
   appropriate changes to display. The handlers only output
   an appropriate text message.

2013/08/16

   Hierarchical library file structure interferes with
   operation of pylint and pydoc.

   Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code,
   tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for bad
   code smells. This is similar but nevertheless different
   from what pychecker provides, especially since pychecker
   explicitly does not bother with coding style. The
   default coding style used by Pylint is close to PEP 8
   (aka Guido's style guide).

   Pydoc is a documentation module for the programming
   language Python. Similar to the functionality of
   Perldoc within Perl, Pydoc allows Python programmers
   to access Python's documentation help files, generate
   HTML pages with documentation specifics, and find the
   appropriate module for a particular job. Pydoc can be
   accessed from a module-specific GUI, from within the
   Python interpreter, or from a command line shell

   Pylint and Pydoc expect to process files from within a
   monolithic file directory. When invoked within a
   hierarchical file directory with its hierarichal
   "package" import mechanism, they report various import
   errors which degrade their usefulness.

   Python files must be "untabified" before being processed
   by tsStripComments to avoid "IndentationError".

   Failure to "untabify" Python source files prior to
   processing by "tsStripComments" may need manual fix-up
   of IndentationError.

2013/08/24

   tsStripComments renders unusable such doc string depend-
   ent modules as tsOperatorSettingsParser

   Blank lines within doc strings are visually used to
   define the end of one paragraph and the start of a new
   one.

   a. tsOperatorSettingsParser uses the text wrap module to
      ensure that text fits within the available run time
      display area.

   b. Text wrap depends on blank lines to avoid merging
      text from separate paragraphs.

   c. Authoring doc strings with blank lines is both
      natural and effective at achieving the correct
      display.

   d. tsStripComments originally did not recognize the
      appropriateness of removing some blank lines but not
      others. An update removed all but the first of a
      sequence of consecutive blank lines.

   e. The main application using a tsOperatorSettings-
      Parser-like module passes the module's launch purpose
      via a doc string which is subject to stripping. All
      other launch parameters (such as title, author, build
      version and build date) are passed by reference to
      the associated labeled doc string. See BuildPurpose
      AttributeError for traceback example when doc string
      deleted and Purpose = __doc__  attempted to pass a
      NoneType.

   f. A simple work around would be to create a purpose
      labeled doc string which will not be subject to
      comment stripping. A reference to the label can then
      be passed instead of the one to the unlabeled doc
      string.

2013/09/04

   test_tsWxGridSizer event processing generates too many
   event messages per button click. Button click event
   handling needs to be directly coupled to keybad button
   window rather than coupled to the parent Frame provided
   handler.

   Partially-compliant wxPython User Interface. Keyboard
   input subject to restrictions:

   tsWxPasswordEntryDialog is derived from tsWxTextEntry-
   Dialog. The latter uses tsWxTextEditBox which has usabil-
   ity issues in both non-event driven and event driven
   modes.

   The non-event-driven mode uses curses.textpad.Textbox
   which monopolizes GUI platform and ignores mouse button
   clicks until the operator terminates input via double
   entry of control-G key. It also, responds to operator
   input after the control-G.

   The event driven mode uses an python emulation of
   curses.textpad.Textbox that provides enhanced edit
   capabilities while recognizing mouse button clicks and
   keyboard press-release activity. However, the display
   blinks as each new text character is displayed. More
   imporrtantly, there is no mechanism to block the appli-
   cation program pending the operator's completion of text
   input.

   Revised readme_bmp_text to describe the Extended Multi-

   Terminal/Emulator standards only support 256 color-pairs
   with 16x16 foreground/background colors. Previous host
   operating system distributions reported, but failed to
   support, up to 256 colors with up to 32767 color-pairs.

   a repository containing source code for both Python 2x
   and Python 3x versions of the Toolkit and Notebook docu-
   mentation in engineering-style application-specific

2010/08/25 (Updated 11/21/2014)

   Undocumented "Curses" / "nCurses" 256 color pair limitation
   constrains support for xterm-88color and xterm-256color
   consoles.

   Workaround provides addition of configuration control switch
   USE_256_COLOR_PAIR_LIMIT to "tsWxGlobals.py" file and support
   for xterm-88color and xterm-256color consoles which is
   equivalent to that for xterm-16color type console. The
   latter provides the automatic mapping of the 68x68 standard
   "wxPython" foreground/background color name combinations into
   the available 16x16 "Curses" / "nCurses" 256 color name pairs.

   Without xterm-16color console type support, use of the 68x68
   standard "wxPython" foreground/background color combinations,
   included in a 71-color palette, will produce both the incor-
   rect color and such unwanted display attributes as underlines,
   blinking etc.

   GUI Object Automatic Layout Anomalies

   Use of wxPython-style sizers to automatically layout complex
   assemblies of GUI Objects typically produce the telescoping
   or overlapping of adjacent border lines into a single line.

   Use of wxPython-style pixel dimensions are associated with
   the nearest available Curses column and row. Anomalies show
   up only when derived pixel dimensions are not integer multi-
   ples of the pixel width and height for the fixed width font
   of a single character. See an example at wxStaticBoxSizer.

   SplashScreen Bitmap Image Compatibility

   Use of a SplashScreen Bitmap image are platform dependent. An
   image created and saved on a Cygwin console reloads and is
   displayed only on a Cygwin console. It does not reload and
   display on a Linux, Mac OS X or Unix xterm.

   The toolkit design therefore creates, saves and installs a
   Bitmap image for each platform. The images are identified
   via their platform-specific names.

A new Splash Screen is built upon the first use of a uniquely sized
command line interface display by those host operating systems that
share this directory.

  NOTE:

    Previous terminal emulator used in a command line interface shell can
    alter the built-in color palette for subsequect terminal emulators.
    Examples:

    1) The final xterm sees no color palette change if the first one is
       xterm followed by xterm-color, vt100 and xterm.

    2) The final xterm sees a dim color palette change if the first one is
       xterm followed by by xterm-16color, vt100 and xterm.

   Instrumentation to facilitate debugging has been left
   activated. Module level variables have been set to enable
   built-in code to log and display both normal progress and
   unexpected events.

   The "tsWxGTUI" Toolkit is a work in progress. Unless one
   is introducing only localized changes, remembering where
   to find and turn debug control flags "on" and "off"
   quickly become tedious and vexing. Ignoring the automa-
   tically generated information until debugging is required
   is relatively painless.

   Consider the lines-of-code metrics and debugging effort
   associated with just the primary Python version 2.x files
   (including documentation, tests and associated data but
   excluding their demo code copies, man pages, tsDocGUI
   files and derived Python 3.x counterparts):

   Development notes ("comments" and "doc strings") are em-
   bedded within each Python source file.

   Prior to publication the notes must be reviewed and edit-
   ed to ensure accuracy, completeness and clarity.

   For a pre-release said notes should be stripped out of
   each source file to be published. The "tsStripCom-
   ments.py" tool is provided for this purpose. Even after
   note stripping, all executable statements (including
   imports, definitions, logic and input/output) will be
   fully human readable.
 
   The "tsStripComments.py" tool must be used with care on
   those top-level application or test files which provide
   an operator with command line help. This is because gen-
   eral purpose command line parsers, such as "tsOperator-
   SettingsParser", expect to receive an application-speci-
   fic purpose-defining doc string, text contained within
   triple quotes (such as """Module Purpose """ or '''Module
   Purpose''') that must not be stripped. The purpose doc
   string is typically unlabeled at or near the begin-
   ning of the file. It is referenced by "__doc__". To
   ensure that it is not stripped, it is suggested that
   the "__doc__" label be explicitly defined via one of
   the following:

   # Implicit label definition override
   __doc__ = """Module Purpose"""
   __doc__ = '''Module Purpose'''

   # Explicit new label definition
   purpose = """Module Purpose"""
   purpose = '''Module Purpose'''

2008/09/03

   Manually Sized Curses Screen

   Host Operating Systems typically provide a Graphical User
   Interface that operates in pixel-mode and can be progra-
   matically sized by an application during its startup.

   Terminal emulators typically provide a Graphical-style
   User Interface that operates in character-mode but pro-
   gramatically sized by an application during its startup.

   Troubleshooting Hints:

   a. Operating Systems typically provide user changeable
      properties to change the font and layout size of the
      shell window in which the application will be run.

   b. If the application aborts itself because it started
      in an under sized shell window, the operator should
      re-adjust the shell window's font and layout prop-
      erties as appropriate.

   Partially-compliant wxPython User Interface

   Keyboard input subject to restrictions:

   a. Apple "Cmd" (Command) Not supported on computer plat-
      forms running Mac OS X, Linux or Windows.

   b. Only "character" events supported; "key" press/release
      events Not supported.

   c. Only "Shift", "Ctrl" or"Alt" key can be pressed in com-
      bination with a character key; combinations of "Shift",
      "Ctrl" and "Alt" keys are Not supported. (Note: The
      "Alt" key event internally involves two separate
      "Curses" getchar operations.)

2012/08/11

   Partially-compliant wxPython User Interface

   Keyboard input subject to restrictions:

   a. tsWxPasswordEntryDialog is derived from tsWxTextEntry-
      Dialog. The latter uses tsWxTextEditBox which has
      usability issues in both non-event driven and event
      driven modes.

   b. The non-event-driven mode uses curses.textpad.Textbox
      which monopolizes GUI platform and ignores mouse but-
      ton clicks until the operator terminates input via
      double entry of control-G key. It also, responds to
      operator input after the control-G.

   c. The event driven mode uses an python emulation of
      curses.textpad.Textbox that provides enhanced edit
      capabilities while recognizing mouse button clicks and
      keyboard press-release activity. However, the display
      blinks as each new text character is displayed. More
      imporrtantly, there is no mechanism to block the ap-
      plication program pending the operator's completion
      of text input.

2013/07/18

   Partially-compliant wxPython User Interface

   test_tsWxGridSizer event processing generates too many
   event messages per button click. Button click event
   handling needs to be directly coupled to keybad button
   window rather than coupled to the parent Frame provided
   handler.
